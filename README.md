Civic Engagement App – SIH 2025 Hackathon Project
This project was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2025, led by me, Sanyam, alongside a dedicated team committed to solving real-world civic challenges through technology. Our mission was to build a mobile-first platform that empowers citizens to actively participate in local governance by reporting infrastructure issues and tracking their resolution.
To ensure our solution was grounded in reality, I personally led field visits and reporting exercises with Nagar Nigam officials, gathering firsthand insights into how civic complaints are currently handled. These interactions revealed gaps in accessibility, transparency, and responsiveness—especially for citizens with limited digital literacy or language barriers.
One of the core innovations of our app is the tender-based contractor bidding system, an idea I proposed to bring fairness and accountability into the resolution process. Verified contractors can bid on reported issues, and their bids are ranked based on cost, speed, user ratings, and a dynamic Trust Score. The Trust Score is calculated using historical performance data, timely completion rates, and citizen feedback—ensuring that reliable contractors are prioritized and incentivized.
Citizens can report issues by uploading geo-tagged photos and using voice-to-text input in regional languages, making the platform inclusive and easy to use. A gamified feedback loop encourages ongoing civic participation—users earn points for reporting issues, verifying fixes, and rating contractor performance. Urgent problems are flagged and visualized through priority mapping, helping authorities allocate resources effectively.
This project blends technology, accountability, and inclusivity to rebuild trust between citizens, contractors, and government bodies. It’s not just an app—it’s a civic movement designed to make governance more participatory, transparent, and responsive.
