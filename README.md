# citizen2contractor
Developed for SIH 2025, this civic app—led by me, Sanyam—empowers citizens to report issues via photos and voice. I led fieldwork with Nagar Nigam to ground our solution. My tender-based bidding idea ensures fair contractor selection. Gamified feedback and priority mapping drive transparency and civic trust.
